## Description

Domenico Scarlatti's Stabat Mater for 10 voices is the most complex and fascinating music for the Roman Catholic liturgy composed by Scarlatti available in modern times. Until recently the Stabat mater was assigned to his time in the Cappella Giulia in Rome. A recent theory places this atypical composition in Lisbon. 
Koorteze is a project chamber choir, composed by experienced amateur singers, specialised in the choral sacred music of the 17th and 18th centuries with specific focus on first performance in modern times of unpublished music.
For this very reason the Kamerkoor Koorteze will perform alongside the Stabat Mater other compositions coming from the Lisbon archives, some of them never performed until now. The evocative Crucifixus for 8 voices by the Venetian composer Antonio Lotti completes the repertoire of this concert.
