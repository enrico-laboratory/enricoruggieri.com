## Description

Tutto lo dì io canto! Every day I sing! Even better… Every day we sing. We sing with our favourite singers playing their music on the radio or on Spotify, we sing to let our children sleep, we sing in the shower, in the car. We sing because we are happy or we sing to cheer up. We sing with our friends, for our friends, we sing for an audience or, maybe, we just sing in our head.
However, what we want to celebrate with this concert is singing together. 
In the far 1500, after a nice dinner, we would have sung the madrigal by Giahces de Wert, Gesualdo, Josquin or Lasso while now we would gather for singing Whitacre, Rutter or why not, some Billy Joel.
We sing music coming from the far Argentina by Carillo or from the “neighbour” Anneke Wittop Koning. 
Singing is telling a story about la nuit by Saint-Saëns or about sharing our most excruciating pain like in O vos Omnes by Carrillo. However, what do we sing about the most? It is love, of course. All its declination and all its most complicated shades give us one of the worthiest experiences in life.
We sing, we sing together for you and we celebrate life together.
